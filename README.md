# SOSCOOKIES

## Installation

The latest version can be downloaded from

	http://neuralquery.com/wordpress/download/neuralquery-soscookies
	
and can be installed by uploading the archive manually in the WordPress backend.

## Updates

The plugin is able to detect available updates and notify them in the backend. This makes it easy to update the plugin directly, without the need for manually uploading a new version again.

If `automatic updates` are enabled, then the plugin will be updated by WordPress without any user interaction.

## Development

Plugin archives can be created by issuing the following command

	git archive --prefix=neuralquery-soscookies/ -o neuralquery-soscookies.zip HEAD
